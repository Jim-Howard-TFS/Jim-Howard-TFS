Jim Howard - Staff Engineer Product Design and Integration.
I've been coding since college - FORTRAN on punchcards for numerical analysis. I've always viewed the ability to code as another skill needed for the modern engineer, regardless of discipline.
Started coding more conventionally in 2013 when introduced to C# .NET by some of my collegues here at Thermo Fisher Scientific.  Since then I've focused on automating any instrument test I need to run.
Soon to retire from TFS - Uploading solutions that may need maintenance or could be used by others (but I truely doubt anyone will ever look at these programs again!!)
